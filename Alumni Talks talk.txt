On day one spent 3 hours setting up my machine for work.
On day Two spent 6 hours setting my work machine for work.
So on day three spent all day trying to automate the process.

Like most problems it's a problem that's been solved before, the challege was to make it work for me, or surfdome.

Use Cases:

My machine, with the basic work setup
Work machine with basic work setup
Work machine with basic work setup AND my own customizations
Old machine with basic work set up that maybe needs updating with new info.


Chose to begin with 1.

The basic idea was to create a repo on github with basic global settings and dotfiles. For me this included some sane vim settings, zshrc and bash settings, a global git ignore, some good basic brew formulaes and apps, basic OSX settings.... the oes on. For yourself depending on work env, might like tmux settings etc.

The conundrum:

So here was the idea, go to the repo clone down the file and run the script new_machine_setup, and away you go.

Except to do that you need git. Which means you need homebrew. Which means you need Xcode command line tools...

Starts to unravel the whole point.

Solution? (maybe ask the audience or keen to hear anyone's at the end)

What I chose:

User goes to the github page( or webpage) and copy pastes the first set of instructions.

This was improved to curl'ing the script from the repo. This:

Installs xcode, installs homebrew installs git. clones the dotfiles repo into home directory, cd's into the dotfiles directory. 

From there you can run:


The various scripts.

If not a completely new machine, can just run symlink script. Will have all the stuff symlinked and setup how it should

If new, you wanna run set_me_up.sh

Let's do that now....











NB use vim markdown presentation





Extension:

Setup Setup script. Set your own vars.
