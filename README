Welcom to Surfdome!

These are our Dotfiles, and as someone once said, dotfiles are made to be forked.

## How to use:

### For new Machines

Fork this repo.
Before you install anything, open the terminal and type this command:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/surfdome/the_setup/master/paddle_out?token=AICa9YA17zbun34nrsM8BY40hamAjgrSks5XEKIewA%3D%3D | sh
```

This will guide you through installing some necessities and cloning the repo down for you in the correct location. Once it's finished, run

```
$ set_me_up
```
in the terminal and ride the wave!
